Ressources for engineering 
==========================

This repository is dedicated to collect and share ressources about engineering for robotic, embedded system and everything about the maker community!
If you are an hobbyist, an enthusiast, a maker or an engineer this repository is for you!
You can use this repository for engineering purposes, for things like [Eurobot](https://www.eurobot.org/) or in a [FabLabs](https://www.fablabs.io/).
Don't hesite to share it !

Ressources are mostly in english :gb:, but some of them are in french :fr: (I'm french ðŸ™‚).

# 1. Embedded Systems
Needed knowleadges: 
- C/C++ 
        [embeddedartistry](https://embeddedartistry.com/beginners/)
        [embeddedartistry](https://embeddedartistry.com/beginners/)
- Basics of electronic -> [Electronical engineering](#2-electronical-engineering)
- Python

In embedded systems, we use MCUs and MPUs to build autonomous electronical systems. 

## 1.1. Maker MCUs
* [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) is one of the most famous microcontroller in the world. It's Open-Source/Hardware and clones are very cheap in China.
* Raspberry-Pi Fondation designed their first microcontroller the [Raspberry-Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-pico/).
* [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) can be program with the arduino framework.

### 1.1.1 Books :books:
* [Le grand livre d'ARDUINO](https://) :fr:
* [Programming Arduino: Getting started with sketches](https://) :gb:
* [Arduino CookBook](https://) :gb: 

### 1.1.2 Development Environment
* [Arduino IDE](http://...) :gb: & :fr: Open-Source IDE
* [Arduino Pro](http://...) :gb: & :fr: Open-Source IDE for pro grade Arduino boards
* [PlatformIO](http://...) :gb: Open-Source IDE for more than 1000 boards!!!

## 1.2. Industrial MCUs
[STM32](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32-32-bit-arm-cortex-mcus.html),
[PIC32](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/microcontrollers-and-microprocessors/32-bit-mcu),
[ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32)
Why 32 bits microcontroller? Why not ! Powerfull, Cheap and use in a lot of systems !

### 1.2.1 Books :books:
* [RTOS with Microcontrollers](http://...) :gb:
* [Advanced Programming with STM32 Microcontrollers](http://...) :gb:
* [Nucleo Boards Programming with the STM32CubeIDE](http://...) :gb:

### 1.2.2 Development Environment
You can program on STM32 with:
* [STM32CubeMX & IDE](http://...) :gb: Development environment provide by STMicroelectronics
* [PlatformIO STM32 tutorial](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/tutorials/ststm32/stm32cube_debugging_unit_testing.html#tutorial-stm32cube-debugging-unit-testing) :gb: Open-Source IDE

You can program on PIC microcontrollers with:
* [MPLAB X IDE](https://) :gb: For development
* [MPLAB X IPE](https://) :gb: To transfert program
* [MPLAB Harmony](https://) :gb: For project creation with libraries

Most (not all) MCUs like Arduino, STM32, PIC32 and ESP32 can be program and debug with:
* [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) :gb: One of the best IDE available for free.

## 1.3. Linux singleboard computers
* [Raspberry-Pi](https://...)
* [Nvidia Jetson-Nano](https://...)

## 1.4. FPGA
FPGA development for embedded system design.

## 1.5. Accessoiries and other stuff
* Debugger and programmer for MCUs
  * [PICkit 4](https://) for PIC8/16/32 bits. The minimal PIC programmer and debugger.
  * [ICD4](https://) for PIC8/16/32 bits. The best PIC programmer and debugger.
  * [ST-Link/V3](https://) for STM8/32. Made by STMicroelectronic for STM-Microcontroller.
  * [SEGGER J-Link](https://) The best one but expensive.
  * [Tag-Connector](https://) PCB connector without component on the board.
